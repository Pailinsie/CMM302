# Cozy Aesthetic Feasibility Study (CMM302)

This repository contains the feasibility-stage code used in my CMM302 research paper.

The purpose of this code is to demonstrate **technical feasibility** at TRL 3–4 by:
- loading a small set of sample images,
- extracting basic visual features (HSV colour statistics and edge density),
- exporting the results to a CSV file,
- confirming that the proposed experimental pipeline can operate end-to-end.

This repository forms the required Feasibility Evidence for the assessment.

Each sample image is automatically assigned a label ("cozy" or "noncozy") based on its filename.  
This allows simple exploratory analysis of differences between cozy and non-cozy visual features.
